# Copy For LLM README

The copy-for-llm extension simply formats code that is copied to your pasteboard in a way that gives an LLM some context on the file that the code is referenced from.

## Features

The main feature of this extension is to prefix the selected text with the current filename and to encase it with code block markdown syntax.
In this way you can quickly give the LLM context around which file you are working in.

Select the text you want to copy over to your LLM chat interface and press `ctr+opt+cmd+c` or select `Copy For LLM: Copy with Filename` from the VSCode Command Palette.
